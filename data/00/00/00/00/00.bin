{\an8}《旺达幻视》前情提要

19
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,110
《旺达幻视》前情提要
Previously on WandaVision...

20
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,530
{\an8}索科威亚遭到袭击

21
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,660
父母是艾莉娜和奥列格
Born to Irina and Oleg Maximoff, 

22
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,280
双双死于空袭
both killed during an air raid

23
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,320
当时马克西莫夫和她的双胞胎哥哥皮特当时十岁
when Maximoff and her twin brother, Pietro, were ten.

24
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,910
这对双胞胎兄妹便成了激进分子  主动加入了九头蛇
The twins were subsequently radicalized, volunteering at HYDRA.

25
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,990
马克西莫夫闯进我们的基地
Maximoff stormed our facility,

26
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,760
偷走了幻视的尸体  把他复活了
stole the Vision's body and resurrected him.

27
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,610
-旺达杀了我吗  -是的  是你叫她这么做的
- Wanda killed me? - Yes. You asked her to do it.

28
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,690
-我做不到  -你可以
- I can't. - You can.

29
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,830
-我回到过去  又死了一次  -不
- I came back and died again. - No!

30
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,700
还让她亲眼看着你死去
And she had to watch.

31
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,620
我的孩子们在哪儿
Where are the twins?

32
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,640
他们可能就在地下室里玩呢
They're probably just playing in the basement.

33
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,820
你不会以为镇上就你一个人会法术吧
You didn't think you were the only magical girl in town, did you?

34
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,870
我叫阿加莎·哈克尼斯
The name's Agatha Harkness. 

35
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,860
终于和你正式见面了  亲爱的
Lovely to finally meet you, dear.

36
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,540
{\an8}马萨诸塞州  塞勒姆

37
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,520
不不不
No, no, no.

38
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,880
不要啊
Please, no.

39
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,030
不要  求你们
No. No, please.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,610
阿加莎·哈克尼斯  你是女巫吗
Agatha Harkness, are you a witch?

41
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,710
是
Yes.

42
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,560
我是个女巫
I am a witch.

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,250
可你却背叛了女巫团
Yet you have betrayed your coven.

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,870
我没有
I have not!

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,390
你偷窃了超出你年龄和地位的知识
You stole knowledge above your age and station.

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,270
你施最黑暗的魔法
You practice the darkest of magic.

47
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,020
我绝对没有犯下这样的罪行
I know... I know nothing of these crimes.

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,900
-我发誓  -不要再撒谎了
- I... I swear it. - Enough deception!

49
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,000
我没打破你的规则
I did not break your rules.

50
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,260
是它们向我的法力屈服了
They simply bent to my power.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,870
等等
Wait.

52
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,280
不  我控制不了它
No. I cannot control it! I...

53
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,160
你们要是肯教我就好了
If only you would teach me!

54
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,160
帮帮我
Help me! Please!

55
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,120
母亲  求你
Mother, please!

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,190
求你  妈妈
Please! Mother!

57
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,150
不
No!

58
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,300
求你  我可以做个好人
Please, I can be good.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,570
不  你做不到
No, you cannot.

60
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,160
什么
What?

61
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,100
是啊
No, I know.

62
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,070
她见到真正的我们好惊讶啊  是吧
She does look shocked to meet the real us, doesn't she?

63
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,330
真可爱
That's adorable.

64
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,830
你别想读我的思想  亲爱的
My thoughts are not available to you, toots.

65
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,660
你从来都读不到
They never, ever were.

66
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,050
所以别累得自己偏头痛了
So don't go givin' yourself a migraine.

67
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,910
我们还有活儿干呢
We've got work to do.

68
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,610
-我的孩子呢  -"我的孩子呢"
- Where are my children? -  "Where are my children?"

69
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,930
你的口音真是时有时无  是吧
That accent really comes and goes, doesn't it?

70
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,180
他们在哪
Where are they?

71
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,090
你的魔法在这里不能用
Oh, your magic's no good here.

72
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,670
你没注意到吗
Didn't you notice?

73
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,750
基本的保护咒  每面墙上一个
Basic protection spell, one in each wall?

74
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,910
怎么  没见过吗
No? Nothing?

75
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,580
它们是如尼文  旺达
These are runes, Wanda.

76
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,200
在某个空间内  只有施如尼文咒的女巫
In a given space, only the witch that cast the runes 

77
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,260
能施展魔法
can use her magic.

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,850
你怎么会连最基本的知识都不知道
How do you not know the fundamentals?

79
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,330
-你是谁  -你是谁
- Who are you? - Who are you?

80
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,230
又是变装  又是换发型
All those costumes and hairstyles.

81
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,220
我多耐心啊
I was so patient,

82
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,790
等着你揭晓真实的自己
waiting for you to reveal your true self.

83
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,330
我用假皮特接近了真相
I got close with fake Pietro.

84
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,280
可以说是假特  但不行
Fietro, if you will, but no dice.

85
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,150
-那是你  -不  并不真是我
- That was you. - No, it wasn't literally me.

86
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,210
是我的耳目
Just my eyes and ears.

87
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,490
透明附身
A crystalline possession.

88
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,150
死灵术不现实
Necromancy was a non-starter

89
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,050
因为你亲哥的尸体在别的大陆上呢
since your real brother's body is on another continent.

90
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,710
而且  还一身弹孔
Not to mention, full of holes.

91
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,650
但你被自己的自我怀疑绊住了
But you're so crippled by your own self-doubt

92
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,360
居然还信了
that you believed it.

93
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,810
旺达啊
Oh, Wanda,

94
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,850
我感知到这里时
oh, when I sensed this place,

95
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,500
那么多咒语瞬间施展出来制造的余晖
the afterglow of so many spells cast all at once...

96
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,850
我怎么也想不通
Oh, I couldn't make heads or tails of it.

97
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,450
心灵控制
Mind control.

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,960
经典
A classic.

99
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,240
快速给一个心智脆弱的家伙施个咒
Quick incantation and a feeble psyche 

100
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,500
就可以了
and you're good to go.

101
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,980
你控制着数千人
With thousands of people under your thumb,

102
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,420
彼此互动
all interacting with each other 

103
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,040
还有复杂的故事线
according to complex storylines.

104
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,290
那可太特别了
Well, that's something special, baby.

105
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,130
当然了  还有变形
And of course, there's transmutation.

106
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,290
研习数年
Years of study 

107
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,430
才能实现最小的逼真幻觉
to achieve even the smallest convincing illusion.

108
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,460
但你视角里的西景  旺达
But Westview through your lens, Wanda...

109
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,050
每一个细节都毫不马虎  甚至是天花线
Every little detail in place down to the crown molding.

110
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,610
你的幻觉甚至
You're even running illusions 

111
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,120
延伸到数英里外的镇边缘
miles away at the edge of town.

112
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,810
自动驾驶的魔法
Magic on autopilot.

113
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,700
你的秘诀何在  姐妹
What's your secret, sister?

114
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,790
听着  我需要你...旺达
Listen, I need you... Hey, Wanda,

115
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,880
告诉我你怎么做到的
I need you to tell me how you did this.

116
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,870
我什么都没做  我不...
I didn't do anything. I'm not...

117
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,000
我试过温柔的手段
I tried to be gentle,

118
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,500
轻轻把你从这荒唐的幻想中唤醒
to nudge you awake from this ridiculous fantasy,

119
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,200
但你宁可崩溃  也不愿面对事实
but you would rather fall apart than face your truth.

120
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,250
你让我别无选择
You left me no choice.

121
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,670
你对你假哥说了什么
What was it you said to your not-brother? 

122
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,580
你只能记得那感觉
All you could recall was the feeling.

123
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,870
你觉得空虚  孤独
You felt empty. Alone.

124
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,460
无尽的虚无
Endless nothingness.

125
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,470
就从那里开始吧
Let's start there.

126
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,170
玩这一阵子的过家家很好玩  是吧  旺达
It's been fun playing pretend for a while, hasn't it, Wanda?

127
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,540
但现在该看看真实的重播了
But it's time to look at some real reruns.

128
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,030
好  走吧
All right, let's go.

129
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,640
不
No.

130
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,450
抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

131
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,480
你是忘了谁把你的孩子
Did you forget who's got your children 

132
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,340
藏在她施了魔法的地下室里了吗
stashed away in her bewitched basement?

133
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:35,100
-妈妈  救命  -妈妈  救命
- Mom! Mom! Help, please, Mom! - Mom, help us!

134
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,550
没错
That's right.

135
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,380
你先请  大明星
After you, superstar.

136
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,730
不错啊  喜欢这冷战审美风格
Charming. Love the Cold War aesthetic.

137
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,200
我们来这里干什么
Why are we here?

138
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,530
妈妈
Mama...

139
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,000
艾莉娜
Irina?

140
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,770
爸爸
Papa...

141
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,550
{\an8}《我爱露西》《家有仙妻》

142
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,060
奥列格
Oleg...

143
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,020
{\an8}别担心  明天全能卖掉

144
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,490
{\an8}今晚继续看电视

145
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,060
-说英语  爸爸  -皮特
- In English, Papa! - Pietro...

146
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,450
他好吵啊  是吧
Oh, he's loud, isn't he?

147
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,570
你说过  电视之夜唯一的规则
You said the only rule of TV night

148
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,290
就是我们努力练习英语
is we try to practice our English.

149
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,800
是啊  他说得对
Yeah. Yes, he is right.

150
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,140
我们只是在把最后一点索科威亚语说完
We were just making rid of last little bit of Sokovian.

151
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,320
你妹妹呢
Where is your sister?

152
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,410
旺达
Wanda?

153
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,970
我们就在这里哦
I mean, we're right here.

154
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,820
旺达
Wanda?

155
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,160
到你了  女士  上场吧
That's your cue, lady. You're on.

156
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,930
我们开始吧  旺达  你选
Now we can begin. Wanda, you pick.

157
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,570
{\an8}《我爱露西》《家有仙妻》

158
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,350
这里没有我喜欢的那个
My pick isn't here.

159
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,070
我忘了
I have forgot.

160
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:15,460
我把它放在了特别的地方  好确保万无一失
I put it in the special place for extra safekeeping.

161
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,090
别看
Don't look. 

162
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,070
好样的
Good job.

163
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,470
拿着
Hold this.

164

Yes, Rob and Laura have for the most fun shenanigans.

170
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,410
"鬼把戏"又是什么来着
What is "Shenanigan" Again?

171
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,210
鬼把戏就像那种问题  但是不可怕  蠢一点
Shenanigan is like problem, but more silly than scary,

172
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,500
但是有时候会有点可怕
but can sometimes be a little scary.

173
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,950
对  就像是恶作剧
Yeah, like mischief.

174
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,440
是很傻的恶作剧  最后总是好结局
But a silly mischief that always becomes fine.

175
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,730
好了  爸爸帮我们开始吧
Okay, Papa start it for us.

176
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,160

And Mary Tyler Moore.

179
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,940
{\an8}看上去可能像是胡桃

180
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,280
旺达
Wanda!

181
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,540

{\an8}斯塔克工业

183
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,850
{\an2}旺达  你没事吧

184
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,450
{\an2}我们得离开这里

185
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,140
{\an8}斯塔克工业

186
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,710
{\an2}不行

187
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,010
{\an2}嘘  你听到什么了吗

188
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,250
{\an2}也许他们是来救我们的

189
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,190
{\an2}也许这些东西就是他们发射的

190
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,130
-我听到了尖叫  -肯定是我尖叫了
- Oh, I heard a scream. - Oh, I must've screamed.

191
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,550
真是一个噩梦啊
Oh, what a night nightmare.

192
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,300
我梦见我是一块石头
I dreamed that I was a Twiloite.

193
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,700
我失去了我的幽默感  还有我的大拇指
And then I lost my sense of humor and my thumbs... 

194
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:32,130
每集最后  你都会意识到一切都只是一个噩梦
At the end of the episode, you realize it was all a bad dream.

195
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,800
一切都不是真的
None of it was real.

196
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,860
{\an8}斯塔克工业

197
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,480
{\an2}旺达  不要

198
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,660
你阻止那个炸弹了吗
Did you stop that bomb?

199
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,560
什么
What?

200
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,510
你用了一个可能六边域
You used a probability hex.

201
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,750
不  我...
No, I...

202
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,290
那一直都没有炸  那...
It just never went off. It was...

203
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,380
那是一个哑弹  我们不知道
It was defective. We didn't know that.

204
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,300
-我们...我们被困住了  -困了多久
- We were... We were trapped. - For how long?

205
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,250
两天
Two days.

206
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,900
那么多的创伤
So much trauma...

207
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,300
但是你们却像小猫一样安全
...and yet you were safe as kittens the whole time.

208
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,540
所以我眼中只看到了一个小女巫  痴迷情景喜剧
So, what I see here is a baby witch, obsessed with sitcoms

209
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,630
需要很多年心理治疗
and years of therapy ahead of her.

210
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,270
这也解释不了你近来的疯狂
Doesn't explain your recent hijinks.

211
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,190
你的超能力是从哪里来的  旺达
Where'd you get the big guns, Wanda?

212
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,400
我不想回到那个时候
I don't wanna go back there.

213
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,100
我知道  但良药苦口  宝贝
I know you don't, but it's good medicine, angel.

214
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,680
要想往前走就只能往回看
The only way forward is back.

215
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,190
旺达  反叛军时期
Ah, Wanda. The rebellious years.

216
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,530
快问快答  你对于你的平民家庭
Quick question, your reaction to the bombing

217
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,360
遭到了轰炸
of your civilian apartment building 

218
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,090
你父母被杀等一系列事的反应
and the murder of your parents

219
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,340
是加入了一个反自由恐怖组织
was to join an anti-freedom terrorist organization.

220
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,210
我们是想要改变世界
We wanted to change the world.

221
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,440
别害怕  这都是你经历过一次的
Don't be scared. You already lived it once.

222
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,330
记录需要  马克西莫夫小姐
For our notes, Miss Maximoff,

223
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,530
你能说出你的姓名  并确认你的状态吗
can you please state your name and confirm your status?

224
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,450
旺达·马克西莫夫  自愿参与
Wanda Maximoff. Volunteer.

225
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,240
开始实验
Begin experimentation.

226
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,280
博士  恕我直言  还没有一个实验体熬过直接...
Doctor, with respect, not one subject has survived direct...

227
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,590
触碰样本
Touch the sample.

228
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,840
那...我只要...
So I... I just...

229
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,740
她还活着  马上对她进行隔离
She's still alive. Get her to isolation now.

230
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,280
宝贝  宝贝和娃娃
Baby, Baby and doll...

231
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,980
我为什么要...
Why do I gotta...

232
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,380
因为我要哄我的宝宝睡觉  就这么简单
Because I'm putting my baby to sleep, that's why.

233
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,160
再播放一次
Play it again.

234
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,080
再来
Again.

235
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,110
这说不通啊
It makes no sense.

236
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,100
那里到底发生了什么
What happened in there?

237
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,430
住手  你会让她难过的
You stop that. You'll hurt her feelings.

238
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,880
她才没有感情呢
She hasn't got any feelings.

239
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,940
她身体里只有锯屑或破布之类的东西
She's full o' sawdust or rags or somethin'.

240
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,720
我现在连吹卡祖笛都不行了
A guy can't even practice his kazoo anymore!

241
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,750
于是小孤女旺达靠近了
So, little orphan Wanda got up close and personal

242
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,090
一颗无限宝石  那颗宝石
with an Infinity Stone that amplified

243
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,860
增强了当时本该消失的你
what, otherwise, would've died on the vine.

244
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,090
你过去的碎片逐渐拼凑成形  亲爱的
The broken pieces of you are adding up, buttercup.

245
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,490
我有个猜想  但我还需要看到更多
I have a theory, but I need more.

246
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,900
等一下
Wait!

247
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,180
旺达  混得越来越好了啊
Oh, Wanda. Movin' on up.

248
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,990
我们现在在哪
So, where are we now?

249
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,050
复仇者基地
The Avengers compound.

250
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,000
我和幻视共享过的第一个家
It was the first home Vision and I ever shared.

251
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,400
皮特死了  我来到一个新国度
Pietro was dead and I was in a new country.

252
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,730
我孤身一人
I was all alone.

253
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,480
幻视
Vision?

254
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,580
抱歉  我并非有意闯入的
I apologize. I don't mean to intrude.

255
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,020
不是吗
You don't?

256
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,890
好吧  我是想要进来
Well, I suppose, yes, I did intend to come in here.

257
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,850
那现在呢
And now?

258
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,370
你喜欢哪个就哪个吧
And... Well, whatever is your preference.

259
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,310
这很好笑
Is it funny 

260
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,050
是因为那个男人刚遭受了严重伤害吗
because of the grievous injury the man just suffered?

261
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,470
不  他并没有真的受伤
No, he's not really injured.

262
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,230
-你怎么能确定  -这不是那种剧
- How can you be certain? - It's not that kind of show.

263
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,350
旺达  我并不自以为知道你现在的感受
Wanda, I don't presume to know what you're feeling,

264
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,540
但我想知道
but I would like to know.

265
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,690
如果你想告诉我
Should you wish to tell me.

266
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,470
如果那能给你带来些许安慰
Should that be of some comfort to you.

267
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,340
你为什么觉得
What makes you think that

268
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,170
谈论这事会给我带来安慰
talking about it would bring me comfort?

269
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,570
我读到过...
Oh, see, I read that the...

270
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,760
唯一能给我带来安慰的
The only thing that would bring me comfort 

271
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,640
是再见到他
is seeing him again.

272
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,660
抱歉
Sorry.

273
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,370
我...
I'm...

274
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,720
我很累
I'm so tired.

275
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,880
就...
It's...

276
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,560
就好像有一个海浪向我打来
It's just like this wave washing over me,

277
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,820
一次又一次
again and again.

278
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,860
把我击倒  当我试图站起来时
It knocks me down, and when I try to stand up,

279
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,720
它又向我打来
it just comes for me again.

280
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,720
我...
And I...

281
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,690
我迟早会被海浪淹没
It's just gonna drown me.

282
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,140
-不  不会的  -是吗
- No. No, it won't. - Yeah.

283
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,610
你怎么知道
How do you know?

284
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,740
因为人生不可能只有悲伤  对吗
Well, because it can't all be sorrow, can it?

285
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,450
我一直都是孤独一人  所以我没感到缺失
I've always been alone, so I don't feel the lack.

286
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,660
我只知道孤独
It's all I've ever known.

287
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,500
我没经历过失去
I've never experienced loss

288
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,980
因为我没有心爱的人可失去
because I have never had a loved one to lose.

289
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:55,130
但悲伤如果不是对爱的坚持  又是什么
But what is grief, if not love persevering?

290
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,590
-抱歉  我不该笑的  -不  的确很好笑
- Sorry. Pardon. - No, it was funny.

291
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,880
是啊  真的很好笑  对吧
Yes, it was very funny, wasn't it?

292
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,730
我总结一下
So, to recap.

293
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,540
爸妈死了  哥哥死了
Parents dead, brother dead,

294
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,960
幻视死了
Vision dead.

295
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,490
他不在你身边
What happened when he wasn't

296
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,300
把你从黑暗中拉回来时发生了什么  旺达
there to pull you back from the darkness, Wanda?

297
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,950
-我坚持不下去了  -撑住  旺达
- I can't do this anymore. - Come on, Wanda!

298
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,440
你已经站在真相悬崖边  你马上就想起来了
You're on the precipice. You are right there!

299
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,460
告诉我你怎么做到的
Tell me how you did it.

300
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,380
幻视不在了
Vision was gone.

301
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,990
但你希望他回来
But you wanted him back.

302
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,380
我希望他回来
I wanted him back.

303
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,610
我希望他回来
I wanted him back.

304
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,990
我知道他在你们这
I know you have him.

305
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,220
-抱歉  但我说了...  -求你
- I'm sorry, but like I said... - Please...

306
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,970
求你了
Please.

307
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,870
我回来时他已经不见了
When I came back, he was gone.

308
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
他的尸体
His body.

309
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,160
我知道他在这里
And I know he's here.

310
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,490
他起码该得到一个葬礼
He deserves a funeral, at least.

311
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,920
我也应该
I deserve it.

312
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,070
是  长官
Yes, sir.

313
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,920
对  她还在这
Yeah, she's still here.

314
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,580
你确定吗
Are you sure?

315
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,050
当然
Of course.

316
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,910
从这个门里进去  沿着走廊直走
Through the doors. Down the hall.

317
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,220
向左转两次  然后再右转
Two lefts and a right.

318
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,680
等下  我帮你开门
One moment. I have to buzz you in.

319
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,360
不用了  谢谢
I got it! Thanks.

320
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,880
旺达·马克西莫夫  很高兴见到你
Wanda Maximoff? It's an honor to meet you.

321
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,540
-真的  -你是谁
- Truly. - Who are you?

322
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,350
泰勒·海沃德局长
Director Tyler Hayward.

323
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,380
我知道你是为了幻视来的
I understand you're here to see the Vision,

324
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,090
想取走他的身体  是吧
to recover the body, that is, is that right?

325
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,110
-我是他的直系亲属  -我明白
- Well, I'm his next of kin. - I understand.

326
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,910
我想给你看点东西
I'd like to show you something.

327
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,400
之后你就能把他还给我了吗
And then you'll give him to me?

328
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,260
请先跟我来
Please, just come with me.

329
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,480
这是什么  你为什么要给我看这个
What is this? Why are you showing me this?

330
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,510
是你要看的
Because you asked to see it.

331
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,700
停下  停下
Stop... Stop...

332
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,030
停下
Stop it!

333
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,430
什么
What...

334
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,200
你们对他做了什么
What are you doing to him?

335
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,250
我们在拆解一件至今为止最复杂
We're dismantling the most sophisticated,

336
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,410
最具感知力的武器
sentient weapon ever made.

337
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,740
但是幻视不是武器  你们不能这么做
But Vision's not a weapon. You can't do this.

338
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,690
实际上  这是我们法律和道义上的义务
In fact, it is our legal and ethical obligation.

339
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,850
我只是想埋葬他  仅此而已
I just wanna bury him. That's all I want.

340
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,410
-你确定吗  -你说什么
- Are you sure? - Excuse me?

341
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,390
不是所有人都可以
Not everyone has the kind of power

342
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,950
重启自己的爱侣的
that could bring their soulmate back online.

343
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,310
不好意思  是复活
Forgive me. Back to life.

344
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,690
我做不到  我
No, I can't do that. It's...

345
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,610
这不是我来这里的目的
That's not why I'm here.

346
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,610
好吧
Okay.

347
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,230
但是我不能允许你
But I cannot allow you to

348
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,450
把价值三十亿美元的振金
take three-billion dollars' worth of vibranium

349
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,250
埋进土壤里
just to put it in the ground.

350
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,060
所以  我只能
So, the best I can do is, 

351
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,280
让你在这里跟他告别
let you say goodbye to him here.

352
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,020
他是我拥有的一切
He's all that I have.

353
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,800
问题就在这里  旺达
Well, that's just it, Wanda.

354
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,220
他不是你的
He isn't yours.

355
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,740
别开枪
Fall back.

356
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,980
没事  让她自己亲眼看看
It's fine. Let her see for herself.

357
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,830
我感觉不到你
I can't feel you.

358
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,230
我感觉不到你
I can't feel you.

359
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,380
{\an8}西景

360
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,680
{\an8}一起慢慢变老的地方

361
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,520
旺达
Wanda.

362
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,160
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

363
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,430
我们今晚就不出去了吧
Should we stay in tonight?

364
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,650
太精彩了 
Bravo!

365
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,760
-妈妈  妈妈  妈妈  帮帮我们  -妈妈  救命
- Mom! Mom! Mom, help us! - Mom! Help!

366
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,740
快来救救我们  妈妈
Please! Please help us! Mom!

367
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,060
妈妈  救命
Mom! Please!

368
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,330
妈妈  妈妈
Mom! Mom!

369
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,940
-我知道你是什么怪物  -妈妈
- I know what you are. - Mom!

370
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,290
没事的  宝贝  没事的
It's okay, baby. It's okay. 

371
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,070
你根本不知道自己有多危险
You have no idea how dangerous you are.

372
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,000
你应该成为一个传说
You're supposed to be a myth.

373
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,470
一个可以自发创造事物的传说人物
A being capable of spontaneous creation,

374
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:36,140
但是你竟然在这里  用你的特异能力做晚餐
and here you are, using it to make breakfast for dinner.

375
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,550
-放开我的孩子  -对了  你的孩子
- Let go of my children. - Oh, yes, your children.

376
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,280
幻视  还有你创造的这个小小世界
And Vision, and this whole little life you've made,

377
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,070
这是混沌魔法  旺达
this is Chaos Magic, Wanda.

378
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,260
所以你是绯红女巫
And that makes you the Scarlet Witch.

379
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,520
长官  队伍已经准备完毕
Sir, the team is ready for launch.

380
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,390
是时候了
It's about time.

381
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,390
我们把这玩意
We took this thing apart

382
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,330
拆拆合合上百万次了
and put it back together again a million times.

383
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,100
也试过了所有能找到的动力源
Tried every type of power supply under the sun,

384
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,180
但其实我们需要的
when all we needed 

385
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,770
只是直接来自源头的能量
was a little energy directly from the source.

386
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,220
一切就绪  长官
Ready, sir.
